# 🎉 Putting It All Together: Mini-Project Ideas!

Now that you’ve explored logic, sets, functions, algorithms, graphs, probability, and linear algebra — it’s time to apply your skills to **real-world inspired coding projects**.

> 🧠 "From logic to algorithms, you’re now a math-powered coder!"

## 🚀 Project Idea 1: Maze Pathfinder

### Goal:
Find the **shortest path** from Start to End in a simple **text-based maze** using **Graph Theory**.

### Concepts Used:
- Graphs (nodes and edges)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Matrix/grid representation

### Example Setup:
```
########
#S#   E#
# # # ##
#     ##
########
```

```python
# Represent maze as 2D grid
# Use BFS to find the shortest path
# Mark visited positions
````

## 📊 Project Idea 2: Simple Data Analyzer

### Goal:

Read a dataset from a `.txt` or `.csv` file and summarize it using **basic statistics**.

### Concepts Used:

* Mean, Median, Mode, Variance
* Data structures (lists, dicts)
* Optional: Text-based bar chart for visualization

```python
import csv
import statistics

# Read numbers from a file
# Compute stats: mean, median, mode
# Print results in clean format
```

---

## 🖼️ Project Idea 3: Image Filter

### Goal:

Create simple **image filters** like blurring or sharpening using matrix math (convolution).

### Concepts Used:

* Linear Algebra (Matrix × Matrix)
* Image manipulation (Pillow library)
* Optional: Use numpy for better performance

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

# Load image
img = Image.open("sample.jpg")

# Apply built-in filter
blurred = img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
blurred.show()
```

> 💡 Advanced: Create your own kernel matrix for custom effects.

## 🤝 Peer Presentation Idea

🎤 **Choose one mini-project idea**, and sketch out how you'd approach it using the math concepts learned:

* What would your input look like?
* What math would you apply?
* How would you present the result?

🗣️ Share your idea in a small group or present to a peer.
